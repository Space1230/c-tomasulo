#+title: Tomasulo Readme
#+author: Andy Sparks

The goal of this project is simple: to implement Tomasulo's algorithm in C.

Eventually it would be cool to turn this into a RISC emulator, but that is not the goal, just getting the algorithm working

Initally, we will just print the output to stdout, but we could do fancier tui things.

We also could eventually simply read from a file and use that for commands, but for now they will be hard-coded to make my life easier
